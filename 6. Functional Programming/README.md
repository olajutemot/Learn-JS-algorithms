------I AM LEARNING Functional Programming IN JAVASCRIPT------
Functional Programming is another popular approach to software development. In Functional Programming, code is organized into smaller, basic functions that can be combined to build complex programs.
In this course, I'll learn the core concepts of Functional Programming including pure functions, how to avoid mutations, and how to write cleaner code with methods like .map() and .filter().

------Learn About Functional Programming------
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means that the logic of a program is expressed without explicitly describing the flow control:

1. Mathematical Functions:
   In functional programming, a function is treated as a mathematical function. This means that a function takes some input, processes it, and produces an output without any side effects.
2. Avoiding Changing State and Mutable Data:
   Functional programming discourages changing the state of variables or using mutable data. Instead, it promotes immutability, where once data is created, it cannot be changed.
3. Declarative Programming Paradigm:
   Functional programming is declarative, meaning that you express what you want to achieve without explicitly stating how to achieve it. This contrasts with imperative programming, where you specify the step-by-step instructions.
4. Pure Functions:
   A pure function is a fundamental concept in functional programming. It produces the same output for the same input and has no side effects.
5. Higher-Order Functions:
   Functional programming makes extensive use of higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions.

------Understand Functional Programming Terminology------
Callbacks are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value, are called higher order functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a lambda.
