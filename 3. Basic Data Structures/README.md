------I AM LEARNING BASIC DATA STRUCTURES IN JAVASCRIPT------
In this Basic Data Structures course, we'll learn more about the differences between arrays and objects, and which to use in different situations. We'll also learn how to use helpful JS methods like splice() and Object.keys() to access and manipulate data.

------Use an Array to Store a Collection of Data------
An array [] can be one-dimensional or multi-dimensional. A one-dimensional array has only one level, i.e it does not have any array or object nested in it. But a multi-dimensional array are arrays that contains other array. we can check the lenght of an array i.e the number of elements in the array by using the Array.lenght method. Arrays are also capable od storing complex objects.
---EXAMPLE 1 (in regex.js file )

------Access an Array's Contents Using Bracket Notation------
we have learnt how to store data inside an array, the purpose of storing data is probably to use them in the future, so how can we access our data that was store?, this can be done using the bracket notation. n an array, each array item has an index. The index of an element can also be termed as the position and a way to reference the position of the element in the array. JavaScript arrays are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element of an array is actually at the zeroth position, not the first. In order to retrieve an element from an array we can enclose an index in brackets and append it to the end of an array, or more commonly, to a variable which references an array object.
---EXAMPLE 2 (in regex.js file )
NOTE: In addition to accessing the value associated with an index, you can also set an index to a value using the same notation:

------Add Items to an Array with push() and unshift()------
arrays are mutable objects and their lenght can be modified by adding element to the either at the begining of the array or at the end. this process of adding one or more new items to an array can be done by the .push() and the .unshift() methods, and this methods are used on the array we want to mutate.
---EXAMPLE 3 (in regex.js file )

------Remove Items from an Array with pop() and shift()------
