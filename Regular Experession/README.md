------I AM LEARNING HOW TO USE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS IN JAVASCRIPT------
Regular Expressions (Regex) are used in programming languages to match parts of strings. we can create patterns to help with that matching. Regular expressions are the patterns that allow us to describe, match, or parse text. With regular expressions, we can do things like find and replace text, verify that input data follows the format required, and other similar things.

------MATCH LITERAL STRINGS AND USING THE REGULAR EXPRESSION METHODS--------
The first Regex method is the .test() method: this method compares the target text with the regular expression and returns a boolean value accordinly, if there is a match, it returns true and if there is no match, it returns false.
---EXAMPLE 1 (in regex.js file )

------MATCHING A LITERAL STRING WITH DIFFERENT POSSIBILITIES-------
This process can also be called the ALTERNATION. Alternation is yet another way you can specify a set of options i.e we can search for multiple patterns using the alternation.

Using regexes like /learn/ in Example 1, you can look for the pattern learn in another string, This is powerful to search single strings, but it's limited to only one pattern. You can search for multiple patterns using the alternation or OR operator: |
---EXAMPLE 2 (in regex.js file )

------IGNORE CASE WHILE MATCHING-------
By default, the regex is case sensitive when matching literals but we can match both cases i.e we can ignore the case sensitivity by using what is called a FLAG. There are other types of flags but the flag that ignore case is the (i) flag. we can use it by appending it to the regex.
---EXAMPLE 3 (in regex.js file )

------EXTRACT MATCHES-------
Before now weve been using the .test() method to know if theres a match in the target string and regex pattern, but we can also extract this match and put them in an array using the .match() method. This is a type of string method analogous to the .test() method which is a type of regex method. To use this method, we apply it to a string and pass in the regex pattern as the argument.
---EXAMPLE 4 (in regex.js file )
NOTE: the .match() syntax is opposite the .test() syntax

------FIND MORE THAN THE FIRST MATCH-------
Before now we have been able to extract or search pattern only once. by default when searching or extracting parttern, it will only extract or search for the first pattern it can find in the target text or string, but to search or extract a pattern more than once, we can use the global search flag (g). we can use it by appending it to the regex.
---EXAMPLE 5 (in regex.js file )
NOTE: we can have multiple flags on our Regex pattern

------Match Anything with Wildcard Period-------
The wildcard character (.) will match any one character. The wildcard is also called dot and period. Sometimes we dont know or we dont need to know the exact charaters in our pattern, in case of a mispelling, thinking of all words that match will tke a long time, but with the wildcard character we can save time.
---EXAMPLE 6 (in regex.js file )

------Match Single Character with Multiple Possibilities-------
Before now we have ben able to learn how to match literal patterns (/learn/) and also using the wildcard character (.). These are both extremes of regular expression as the former matches the exact pattern and the latter matches every possible patterns. in cases where we want to match a single pattern but with differnt possible characters of our choice, we can make use of the character class ([]), and with this we can search for a literal pattern with some flexibility. Character classes allow us to define a group of characters we wish to match by placing them inside square ([ and ]) brackets.
---EXAMPLE 7 (in regex.js file )

------Match Letters of the Alphabet and Range of Numbers-------
Earlier we were able to use character class to specify a group of characters to be matched. In cases where we want to match a large set of alphabets like from (A to Z) or (1 to 100) that will be a lot of typing, so we can define a range of characters inside a character set using a hyphen (-).
---EXAMPLE 8 (in regex.js file )
NOTE: it is possible to combine a range of letters and numbers in a single character set.

------Match Not Specified Single Characters Using The Negated Character Sets-------
Before now weve been creating a set of characters we want to match, we can also specify a set of charater we do not want to match. to do this we place a caret character (^) after the opening bracket and before the characters you do not want to match like this ([^...]). it will match any character that is not listed inside the square brackets.
---EXAMPLE 9 (in regex.js file )

------Match Characters that Occur One or More Times-------
sometimes we want to match characters thats occurs more than one time and this can be done by making use of quantifiers. Quantifiers denote how many times a character, a character class, or group should appear in the target text for a match to occur. here we will be talking about the (+) character. we can use the (+) character to check if a character occurs at least one or more times. Remember, the character or pattern has to be present consecutively. That is, the character has to repeat one after the other.
---EXAMPLE 10 (in regex.js file )

------Match Characters that Occur Zero or More Times-------
another type of quantifier is the _ character, this character is similar to the (+) character but with a slight difference. When we append (_) to a character, it means we want to match any number of that character including none.
---EXAMPLE 11 (in regex.js file )

------Find Characters with Lazy Matching-------
Quantifiers by defaulr are greedy, i.e they try to match every possible characters, in regular expression we call this a greedy match. The alternative is called a lazy match, which finds the smallest possible part of the string that satisfies the regex pattern. we can use the ? character to change the default greediness of quantifiers to lazy matching.
---EXAMPLE 12 (in regex.js file )

------Match Patterns at the Beginning AND End of String-------
Anchors are metacharacters that match the start and end of a line of the target text. we use them to assert where a boundary should be.
The two characters used are (^) and ($).
Befor Now, we used the caret character (^) inside a character set to create a negated character set in the form ([^...]). Outside of a character set, the caret is used to search for patterns at the beginning of strings.
---EXAMPLE 13 (in regex.js file )

------Match All Letters and Numbers-------
Before now, we've learnt that we can match all the letters of the alphabet and number using a range in the character class like so [a-Z0-9], but this method can be replaced with a shortcut, although it includes a few extra characters as well. The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is (\w). This shortcut is equal to [A-Za-z0-9_]. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character.
---EXAMPLE 14 (in regex.js file )

------Match Everything But Letters and Numbers-------
we can also match everything in a target text excpect the alphanumerics and underscore using a shorthand (\W), Note the difference is the lettercase. (\W) is the shorthand for [^A-Za-z0-9_]. this means we can search for the opposite of the (\w) with (\W).
---EXAMPLE 15 (in regex.js file )

------Match All Numbers and Non Numbers-------
Another shortcut we can learn about allows us to match all the numbers in a target text 1.e instead of using the character class like so [0-9], we can use the shorthand (\d). We can also match all non digit or numbers in the target text by using the uppercase D like so (\D) which is the shorthand for [^0-9]
---EXAMPLE 16 (in regex.js file )

------EXERCISE 1-------
-----Restrict Possible Usernames
Usernames are used everywhere on the internet. They are what give users a unique identity on their favorite sites.
You need to check all the usernames in a database. Here are some simple rules that users have to follow when creating their username.

--Usernames can only use alphanumeric characters.

--The only numbers in the username have to be at the end. There can be zero or more of them at the end. Username cannot start with the number.

--Username letters can be lowercase and uppercase.

--Usernames have to be at least two characters long. A two-character username can only use alphabet letters as characters.

---EXERCISE 1 SOLUTION (in regex.js file )

------Match Whitespace-------
Before now, we have covered matching letters of the alphabet and numbers. we can also match the whitespace or spaces between letters.
we can search for whitespace using (\s), which is a lowercase s. This pattern not only matches whitespace, but also carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. we can think of it as similar to the character class [ \r\t\f\n\v]. we can also search for non-whitespace using \S, which is an uppercase s. This pattern will not match whitespace, carriage return, tab, form feed, and new line characters. You can think of it being similar to the character class [^ \r\t\f\n\v].
---EXAMPLE 17 (in regex.js file )

------Specify Upper and Lower Number of Matches-------
Before now, we have used the Quantifiers + and asterik character to look for one or more of the caharacter and none or more of the character respectively, which is a convienient way, but sometimes we want to match a certain range of patterns, this can be done by the interval quantifier {N,M}. This is used to specify a range for the minimum and maximum possible match. For example /\d{3, 6}/ means match a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 6 consecutive digits.
---EXAMPLE 18 (in regex.js file )

------Specify Only the Lower Number of Matches or Exact number of matches-------
we can also specify only the lower range. For example /\d{3, }/ means match a minimum of 3 and more consequtive digits. sometimes we want to specify the exact number of matches we want, {N}, when appended to a character or character class, specifies how many of the character we want. For example /\d{3}/ means match three consecutive digits
---EXAMPLE 19 (in regex.js file )

------Check for All or None-------
Sometimes the patterns we want to search for may have parts of it that may or may not exist. However, it may be important to check for them nonetheless.
We can specify the possible existence of an element with a question mark, ?. This checks for zero or one of the preceding element. We can think of this symbol as saying the previous element is optional.
For example, there are slight differences in American and British English and we can use the question mark to match both spellings.
