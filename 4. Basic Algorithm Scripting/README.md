------I AM LEARNING BASIC ALGORITHM SCRIPTING IN JAVASCRIPT------
An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.
To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.
In this course, we'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.

------Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit------
The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.
---EXAMPLE 1
You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and assign it the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent to the given Celsius temperature. Use the formula mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.\
---SOLUTION 1 (in regex.js file )

------Reverse a String------
a character in a string can be indexed, just like an array that is zero-index a string is also zero-indexed. we can also use the for loop to iterate through a string.
---EXAMPLE 2
Reverse the provided string and return the reversed string.
"hello" should become "olleh".
---SOLUTION 2 (in regex.js file )

------Factorialize a Number------
We can Return the factorial of the provided integer.
If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!
Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function
---SOLUTION 3 (in regex.js file )

------Find the Longest Word in a String------
---EXAMPLE 4
Return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.
Your response should be a number.
