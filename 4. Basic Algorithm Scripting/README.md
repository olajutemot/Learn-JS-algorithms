------I AM LEARNING BASIC ALGORITHM SCRIPTING IN JAVASCRIPT------
An algorithm is a series of step-by-step instructions that describe how to do something.
To write an effective algorithm, it helps to break a problem down into smaller parts and think carefully about how to solve each part with code.
In this course, we'll learn the fundamentals of algorithmic thinking by writing algorithms that do everything from converting temperatures to handling complex 2D arrays.

------Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit------
The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.
---EXAMPLE 1
You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and assign it the Fahrenheit temperature equivalent to the given Celsius temperature. Use the formula mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.\
---SOLUTION 1 (in regex.js file )

------Reverse a String------
a character in a string can be indexed, just like an array that is zero-index a string is also zero-indexed. we can also use the for loop to iterate through a string.
---EXAMPLE 2
Reverse the provided string and return the reversed string.
"hello" should become "olleh".
---SOLUTION 2 (in regex.js file )

------Factorialize a Number------
We can Return the factorial of the provided integer.
If the integer is represented with the letter n, a factorial is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.
Factorials are often represented with the shorthand notation n!
Only integers greater than or equal to zero will be supplied to the function
---SOLUTION 3 (in regex.js file )

------Find the Longest Word in a String------
---EXAMPLE 4
Return the length of the longest word in the provided sentence.
Your response should be a number.
---SOLUTION 4 (in regex.js file )

------Return Largest Numbers in Arrays------
Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.
Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i].
---SOLUTION 5 (in regex.js file )

------Confirm the Ending------
Check if a string (first argument, str) ends with the given target string (second argument, target).
This challenge can be solved with the .endsWith() method, which was introduced in ES2015. But for the purpose of this challenge, we would like you to use one of the JavaScript substring methods instead.
---SOLUTION 6 (in regex.js file )

------Finders Keepers------
Create a function that looks through an array arr and returns the first element in it that passes a 'truth test'. This means that given an element x, the 'truth test' is passed if func(x) is true. If no element passes the test, return undefined.
---SOLUTION 7 (in regex.js file )

------Title Case of a String------
Return the provided string with the first letter of each word capitalized. Make sure the rest of the word is in lower case.
For the purpose of this exercise, you should also capitalize connecting words like the and of.
---SOLUTION 8 (in regex.js file )

------Example on Splice & Slice------
You are given two arrays and an index.
Copy each element of the first array into the second array, in order.
Begin inserting elements at index n of the second array.
Return the resulting array. The input arrays should remain the same after the function runs.
---SOLUTION 9 (in regex.js file )

------Example on Falsy Bouncer------
Remove all falsy values from an array. Return a new array; do not mutate the original array.
Falsy values in JavaScript are false, null, 0, "", undefined, and NaN.
Hint: Try converting each value to a Boolean.
---SOLUTION 10 (in regex.js file )
